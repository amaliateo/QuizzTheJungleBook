    <string name="youknowOne">Just after Mowgli runs away and Bagheera is trying to convince Col. Hathi
        to look for him, Hathi\'s wife Winifred announces if they don\'t help find him,
        she will take command of the herd. Hathi is outraged at the thought of a female leading.
        The joke is that elephants herds are led by a matriarch (female),
        while adult males generally live alone. As the only apparent female in the herd,
        Winifred should be leading by default.</string>
